name: TravelToLocation
description: "Travel to a specific named location. STRICT RULES - Only use this action when ALL of the following are true:
  1. The PLAYER has directly and clearly told the actor to go somewhere (e.g. 'Go to Whiterun', 'Head to the Bannered Mare', 'Travel to Solitude')
  2. The destination is a specific, real named location (not vague like 'away' or 'somewhere')

  Do NOT use this action if:
  - A location was merely mentioned in conversation
  - The actor wants to go somewhere on their own initiative
  - The actor is upset, angry, or emotional (use dialogue to express that instead)
  - The actor is suggesting they could go somewhere (just suggest it in dialogue, don't actually go)
  - The player has not explicitly directed the actor to travel

  The only exception is if the player explicitly agrees to an actor's suggestion to travel together (e.g. Actor: 'Shall we head to Riften?' Player: 'Yes, lead the way')."
