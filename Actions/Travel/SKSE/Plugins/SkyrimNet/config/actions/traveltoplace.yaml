description: "Travel to a named location, relative direction, or nearby feature. STRICT RULES - Only use this action when ALL of the following are true:
  1. The PLAYER has directly and clearly told the actor to go somewhere (e.g. 'Go to Whiterun', 'Head to the Bannered Mare', 'Go outside', 'Wait upstairs', 'Go to the bar', 'Wait by the shrine')
  2. The destination is a specific named location, a semantic direction (outside, inside, upstairs, downstairs), OR a nearby feature (bar, kitchen, forge, shrine, bed, fireplace, table, enchanter, chest, door)

  Do NOT use this action if:
  - A location was merely mentioned in conversation
  - The actor wants to go somewhere on their own initiative
  - The actor is upset, angry, or emotional (use dialogue to express that instead)
  - The actor is suggesting they could go somewhere (just suggest it in dialogue, don't actually go)
  - The player has not explicitly directed the actor to travel
  - The destination is truly vague like 'away' or 'somewhere'

  The only exception is if the player explicitly agrees to an actor's suggestion to travel together (e.g. Actor: 'Shall we head to Riften?' Player: 'Yes, lead the way')."
