name: CompanionFollow
description: "Stop waiting and resume following {{ player.name }}.
  Use this action when {{ player.name }} returns to a waiting NPC and asks them to follow
  again, come along, move out, or resume traveling together.

  The NPC must currently be waiting (told to wait earlier) to use this action.

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - The NPC is already following {{ player.name }} (they're not waiting)
  - {{ player.name }} is recruiting someone for the first time (use SetCompanion instead)
  - {{ player.name }} wants to dismiss a companion (use DismissFollower instead)"
