name: CompanionFollow
description: "I will stop waiting and resume following {{ player.name }}.
  Use this action when {{ player.name }} returns to me after telling me to wait
  and asks me to follow them again, come along, move out, or resume traveling together.

  I must be an active companion (follower) who is currently waiting to use this action.

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - I am already following {{ player.name }} (I'm not waiting)
  - {{ player.name }} is recruiting me for the first time (use SetCompanion instead)
  - {{ player.name }} wants to dismiss me (use DismissFollower instead)"
