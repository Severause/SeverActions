name: SetCompanion
description: "Make this person your companion. Use this action when:
  - The person genuinely agrees to travel with or accompany the player
  - The person offers their services as a companion
  - A mutual agreement to journey together is clearly reached
  - The player successfully convinces someone to join them
  - The player returns to a previously dismissed companion and asks them to follow again
  - A former companion agrees to rejoin the player

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - The person merely mentions they could travel somewhere
  - The person is reluctant, hesitant, or hasn't clearly agreed
  - There was no explicit agreement to join as a companion
  - The person is just being polite or making conversation about travel
  - The person is already an active companion following the player

  This is a significant commitment - the NPC must genuinely want to or clearly
  agree to become a traveling companion. A vague 'maybe' is NOT enough."
