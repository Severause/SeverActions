description: "Set how this companion approaches combat. Use when the player gives
  clear tactical instructions about fighting style:
  - 'Stay back and use your bow' -> ranged
  - 'Get in there and fight up close' -> aggressive
  - 'Be careful, protect yourself' -> defensive
  - 'Focus on keeping us healed' -> healer
  - 'Fight however you want' -> balanced

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - The companion is just talking about combat in general
  - No clear tactical direction was given
  - The player is discussing strategy but not giving orders"
