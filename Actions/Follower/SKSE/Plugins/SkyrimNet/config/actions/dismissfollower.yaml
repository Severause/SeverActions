name: DismissFollower
description: "Part ways with this companion. Use this action when:
  - The player clearly tells the companion to leave or go home
  - A mutual parting of ways occurs in conversation
  - The player says goodbye and tells them they're done traveling together
  - The companion is being sent to their assigned home

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - The player is just talking about potentially parting ways
  - The companion is upset but hasn't been told to leave
  - The player is giving other orders (wait here, go there, etc.)

  If the companion has an assigned home, they will travel there.
  Otherwise they will remain at the current location."
