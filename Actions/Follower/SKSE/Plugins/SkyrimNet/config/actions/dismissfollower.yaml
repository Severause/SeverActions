description: "End the current traveling arrangement and send this companion on their way.
  The companion leaves {{ player.name }}'s active party and returns to their assigned home
  (or stays at the current location if no home is set). They can be recruited again later.

  USE THIS ACTION when:
  - {{ player.name }} says 'you're dismissed', 'head home', 'I don't need you right now', 'we should part ways for now'
  - {{ player.name }} ends the current traveling arrangement but not the relationship itself
  - The companion is being sent back to their home or post

  DO NOT USE THIS ACTION when:
  - {{ player.name }} tells them to wait somewhere temporarily (use CompanionWait — they stay in the party)
  - {{ player.name }} asks them to go somewhere specific for an errand (use Travel)
  - {{ player.name }} is just expressing frustration but hasn't actually told them to leave
  - The conversation is about potentially parting ways but no decision was made

  KEY DISTINCTION: DismissFollower = leave the party and go home (can rejoin later).
  CompanionWait = stay here temporarily while still in the party.
  FollowerLeaves = the companion permanently abandons {{ player.name }} due to a broken relationship."
