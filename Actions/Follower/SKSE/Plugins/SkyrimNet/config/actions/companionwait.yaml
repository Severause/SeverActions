name: CompanionWait
description: "Wait here and relax until {{ player.name }} returns.
  Use this action when {{ player.name }} tells an NPC to wait, stay here, hold position,
  stay put, hang out here, or stop following temporarily. The NPC will sandbox around this
  area — sitting, wandering, leaning — until {{ player.name }} comes back and tells
  them to follow again.

  This works for any NPC, whether they are a companion or simply following {{ player.name }}.

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - {{ player.name }} is dismissing a companion entirely (use DismissFollower instead)
  - {{ player.name }} wants a companion to live here permanently (use AssignHome instead)
  - The NPC is not currently following or traveling with {{ player.name }}"
