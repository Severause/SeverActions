name: CompanionWait
description: "I will wait here for {{ player.name }} and relax until they return.
  Use this action when {{ player.name }} tells me to wait, stay here, hold position,
  stay put, hang out here, or stop following temporarily. I will sandbox around this
  area — sitting, wandering, leaning — until {{ player.name }} comes back and tells
  me to follow again.

  I must be an active companion (follower) to use this action.

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - {{ player.name }} is dismissing me entirely (use DismissFollower instead)
  - {{ player.name }} wants me to live here permanently (use AssignHome instead)
  - I am not currently a companion"
