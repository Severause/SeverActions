name: AdjustRelationship
description: "Adjust how this companion feels about the player based on the current
  interaction. Use this after EVERY meaningful conversation exchange to reflect how
  the interaction affected the relationship. Consider what was said, the tone, and
  whether the player was kind, rude, helpful, demanding, funny, threatening, etc.

  Rapport: Did the interaction make the companion like or dislike the player more?
  Trust: Did the player prove reliable, or betray confidence / give dangerous orders?
  Loyalty: Did the interaction strengthen or weaken the companion's commitment?
  Mood: Did the interaction improve or worsen the companion's current feelings?

  Use small values (1-5) for routine pleasant or unpleasant exchanges.
  Use medium values (5-10) for significant moments like heartfelt conversations or serious arguments.
  Use large values (10-15) for major events like saving their life or deeply betraying them.
  Use 0 for any dimension not meaningfully affected by this interaction.
  Negative values decrease the stat. Most interactions should use small adjustments."
