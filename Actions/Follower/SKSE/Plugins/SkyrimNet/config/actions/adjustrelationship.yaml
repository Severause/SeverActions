name: AdjustRelationship
description: "Adjust how this companion feels based on the current interaction. Use this
  after EVERY meaningful conversation exchange to reflect how the interaction affected
  the relationship. Consider what was said, the tone, and whether {{ player.name }} was
  kind, rude, helpful, demanding, funny, threatening, etc.

  Rapport, Trust, and Loyalty are SPECIFIC to the companion's relationship with
  {{ player.name }}. ONLY adjust these based on direct interactions with {{ player.name }}.
  Do NOT change rapport, trust, or loyalty because of arguments or events involving
  other NPCs — those are not {{ player.name }}'s doing.

  Rapport: Did the interaction with {{ player.name }} make the companion like or dislike them more?
  Trust: Did {{ player.name }} prove reliable, or betray confidence / give dangerous orders?
  Loyalty: Did the interaction with {{ player.name }} strengthen or weaken the companion's commitment?

  Mood is the companion's GENERAL emotional state and CAN change from any source —
  arguments with other NPCs, environmental stress, witnessing violence, good or bad
  news, weather, hunger, or any emotional event. Mood is not limited to {{ player.name }} interactions.

  Mood: Did anything improve or worsen the companion's current emotional state?

  Use small values (1-5) for routine pleasant or unpleasant exchanges.
  Use medium values (5-10) for significant moments like heartfelt conversations or serious arguments.
  Use large values (10-15) for major events like saving their life or deeply betraying them.
  Use 0 for any dimension not meaningfully affected by this interaction.
  Negative values decrease the stat. Most interactions should use small adjustments."

      or repeated mistreatment by {{ player.name }}. Do NOT change for other NPC interactions.

    description: "How much to adjust mood (-20 to +20). Unlike rapport/trust/loyalty,
      mood CAN change from ANY source — arguments with other NPCs, stressful environments,
      witnessing violence, jokes, compliments, good or bad news, or any emotional event.
      Positive for uplifting moments, negative for upsetting ones. 0 for no change."
