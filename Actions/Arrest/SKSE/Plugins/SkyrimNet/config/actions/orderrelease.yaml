customCategory: arrest
name: OrderRelease
description: "Order a prisoner to be released. The sender commands the guard to free the
  prisoner from their restraints and let them go.

  This action is only available when a guard has just brought a prisoner before the
  sender for judgment (after a DispatchGuardToArrest with a sender). The prisoner is
  standing in cuffs, the guard is holding them, and the sender makes the call.

  Use this action when:
  - The sender decides to show mercy and release the prisoner
  - The prisoner made a convincing plea or argument
  - The sender believes the prisoner is innocent or the crime was minor
  - The sender decides to let them off with a warning

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - No prisoner has been brought before the speaker for judgment
  - The speaker is not the person who ordered the arrest
  - The speaker wants the prisoner taken to jail (use OrderJailed instead)
  - The prisoner is already in jail or already released"
