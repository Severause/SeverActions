name: AddBountyToPlayer
description: "IMPORTANT: Use this action FIRST when a guard witnesses the player committing a crime.\n  This adds bounty to the player's record in that hold. Without bounty, ArrestPlayer will fail.\n\n  When to use ReportCrime:\n  - Guard sees player attack someone (assault) - typically 40-200 gold\n  - Guard sees player steal something (theft) - typically 75-300 gold based on value\n  - Guard sees player kill someone (murder) - typically 1000-3000 gold\n  - Guard sees player break into a building (trespass) - typically 75-150 gold\n  - Guard sees player pickpocket someone (pickpocket) - typically 25-175 gold\n  - Guard is annoyed/provoked by player behavior (contempt) - 50-200 gold at guard's discretion\n  - Guard abuses their authority to harass player (abuse of power) - any amount\n\n  Guards can also add arbitrary bounty if they feel justified, such as when the player\n  is being disrespectful, loitering suspiciously, or the guard simply wants to assert\n  their authority. Corrupt or power-tripping guards may fabricate charges.\n\n  After reporting a crime and adding bounty, the guard can then use ArrestPlayer to\n  confront the player about their bounty. The bounty accumulates - multiple crimes\n  add up to a larger total bounty."
