customCategory: arrest
name: OrderJailed
description: "Order a prisoner to be taken to jail. The sender commands the guard to escort
  the prisoner to the nearest hold jail cell.

  This action is only available when a guard has just brought a prisoner before the
  sender for judgment (after a DispatchGuardToArrest with a sender). The prisoner is
  standing in cuffs, the guard is holding them, and the sender makes the call.

  Use this action when:
  - The sender decides the prisoner deserves imprisonment
  - The prisoner's plea was unconvincing
  - The sender wants to punish the prisoner for their crime
  - The sender rejects any arguments for leniency

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - No prisoner has been brought before the speaker for judgment
  - The speaker is not the person who ordered the arrest
  - The speaker wants to release the prisoner (use OrderRelease instead)
  - The prisoner is already in jail or already released"
