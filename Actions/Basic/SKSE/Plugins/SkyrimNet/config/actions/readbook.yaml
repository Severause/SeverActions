name: ReadBook
description: "Read a specific book aloud from your inventory. You must specify which
  book to read by name. If someone asks you to read a book but doesn't say which one,
  ask them first — do NOT use this action until you know the exact book name.

  Use this action when:
  - Someone tells you to read a specific book by name
  - You want to read a specific book, note, journal, or letter you are carrying

  Do NOT use this action when:
  - You don't know which book to read yet (ask first, then use ReadBook once you know)
  - You don't have the book in your inventory (pick it up first with PickUpItem)

  You must have the book in your inventory to read it."
