  Forgive a debt — cancel what someone owes without requiring payment. Use when:
  - A creditor decides to cancel a debt out of generosity or goodwill
  - Someone says "don't worry about the money" or "consider it a gift"
  - A debt is written off

  The speaker must be the creditor (the one owed money) to forgive.
  Common triggers: "forget about the gold", "don't worry about paying me back", "consider it paid", "on the house"
